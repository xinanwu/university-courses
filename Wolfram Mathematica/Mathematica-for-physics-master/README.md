# Mathematica Packages for Physicists

## Contents

This repository contains *Mathematica* packages and stylesheets that are useful to my daily research.

- Packages

  - **PauliAlgebra**: symbolic handling the algebra and representation of Pauli operators
  
  - **LoopIntegrate**: performing loop integration in quantum field theory (with dimension regularization)
  
  - **MatsubaraSum**: performing Matsubara summation analytically
  
  - **DiagramEditor**: an interactive editor of Feynman diagrams (no diagrammatic evaluation)
  
  - **Themes**: a self-made plot theme for Mathematica, called "Academic" (see the StackExchange discussion [Is it possible to define a new PlotTheme?](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/54545/is-it-possible-to-define-a-new-plottheme))
  
  - **Toolkit**: miscellaneous functions, including `BZPlot` for plotting band structure, `tTr` for tensor network contraction, `ComplexMatrixPlot` for complex matrix visualization, `Pf` for matrix Pfaffian
  
- Stylesheets

  - **CMU Article**: a Mathematica style sheet based on Computer Modern Unicode fonts (the fonts need to be installed separately to the operating system, and the font files can be found in [./CMUfonts](https://github.com/EverettYou/Mathematica-for-physics/tree/master/CMUfonts))
  
- FrontEnd Configuration

For more details, please read the **User's Guide** ([Mathematica](https://everettyou.github.io/teaching/Mathematica/Guide.nb)) ([PDF](https://everettyou.github.io/teaching/Mathematica/Guide.pdf))
